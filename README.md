# Story2
i experiment with branching and merging
first i will make a file in my main branch
i will commit this file i just made
then i will make a new branch called experimental
i will make changes to my first file in this new branch and then commit it
then i will go back to my main branch and make a new file there
i will commit this file too
now i will merge my experimental branch with my main branch
now i will orientate myself to all the new features
